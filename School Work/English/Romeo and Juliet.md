### DNA

Romeo uses the language of classical poetry, and many people think that because he speaks in this elaborate way, his emotions are 'artificial', not genuine and sincere. What do you think? Does using extravagant imagery, wordplay, antithesis and rhyming couplets show that he is really in love, as he claims to be, or just infatuated?

I believe that Romeo is just infatuated with Juliet, as he has only recently gotten over Rosaline and has been only obsessed with seeing her again.

### Juliet Describes Love - Act 2, Scene 2

Juliet makes reference to the moon as a symbol of inconstancy in love.
She uses the word idolatry to suggest that she worships Romeo like a god.
She likens the love she shares with Romeo to lightning.
She compares their young love to a rose that has yet to flower.
She suggests that her love is a boundless and deep as the sea.
