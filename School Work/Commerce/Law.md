### DNA

1. What are laws and why do we have them?
2. Explain the three levels of government
3. Evaluate the importance of a local government.

### Study of Three Sets of Laws (2000 BC)

The earliest known written account of laws are from King Hammurabi of Babylon (modern-day Iraq). He ordered stone pillars to be constructed with 280 laws for people to obey. They were written in 2000 BC

Some of these laws included:

Rule 1: If a man accuses another but cannot offer proof, he shall die.  
Rule 195: If a son strikes his father, he shall lose his fingers.  
Rule 161: If a woman belittles her husband, she shall be thrown into the river.  
Rule 196: If someone should blind the eye of another, they shall blind his eye.

### Study of Three Sets of Laws (13th Century BC)
Christianity adopted the Ten Commandments, a set of laws written by Moses in the Bible.

They include:

4. You shall remember the Sabbath and keep it holy (Sunday)
5. Honour your father and mother
8. You shall not steal

### Study of Three Sets of Laws (7th Century BC)

Muslims adopted the Five Pillars of Islam, based on the teachings of the prophet Muhammad. 

Simplified, they are written:

1. There is only one god, Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger.
2. You shall pray five times a day facing Mecca
3. Fast for one month every year 
4. You must pay tax on property
5. You must visit Mecca at least once in your life

### In Australia


Before 1788, Indigenous Australians had their own law, passed on by word of mouth. It was important because it helped them maintain a stable society.

After colonisation, the British did not recognise any pre-existing laws. Indigenous people were expected to obey British laws. This created many misunderstandings and problems for everyone.

- Explain why the employer was negligent
The employer was negligent as he had a worker who did not know what he was doing do something which was for someone in a different career. As the owner of the house was not notified, Allan was injured. This meant that Joe - the employer - was responsible, as he both made Allan do a job he was not qualified for, as well as not notifying the residents of the house.

- Decide if the following examples are examples of negligence.
	- On a busy, hot summer day, a lifeguard leaves the beach for five minutes to get a drink. In the meantime, a swimmer is calling out for help. The swimmer drowns and his parents decide to sue.

A minor wishes to enter into a contract to get a mobile phone. As he is unable to on his own, he asks his parent to sign it for him so he can sign up. For the first payment, he fails to pay and his parent is left with the responsibility to pay. The parent decides not to, as it was not even the first payment and was shocked at the fact their son didn't pay - and the mobile phone company believes that this is fraud, and sues the company.

### Important People in a Courtroom

Judge / Magistrate

The Judge presides over the court and deals with any legal issues that arise during the trial. He/She informs the jurors about their role and instructs them about what the law is. The Magistrate hears cases and makes decisions in the Magistrates’ Court and Children’s Court. They determine the order of proceedings, whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty and assign penalties to the defendant.

When you speak to a magistrate or judge, you should address them as ‘Your Honour’.

DEFENDANT/ACCUSED

In a Criminal Trial the person who has been charged with committing an offence is called the ‘accused’. In a Civil Trial the parties are called the plaintiff and the defendant:

PLAINTIFF

This is the person bringing the action, or ‘suing’ the other person.

DEFENDANT

This is the person defending the action, or being ‘sued’.

These people are the reason why the court is “in session”.

DOCK

The Dock is where the Defendant or person on trial stands before the court.

PROSECUTING BARRISTER

The Prosecuting Barrister creates a case against the Defendant to prove why they should be held responsible for a charge. They must stand up when addressing the Magistrate/Judge, questioning a witness or when ‘objecting’.

DEFENCE BARRISTER

The Defence Barrister provides a defence case that shows why the Defendant is not responsible for the charge.

JURY

A jury consists of people whose names appear on the electoral roll. Jurors are selected for both civil and criminal cases in the County and Supreme Courts to ensure a ‘trial by peers’. The jury must listen to all the evidence and determine whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.
