# The Roles of Government

### DNA

A person is arrested for stealing a loaf of bread from a supermarket. They are charged with larceny (theft). They said they stole the bread because they did not have the money to pay for it and had to feed their family and thought it was a small enough value for it to not matter.

Should the person be punished?


### Three Levels of Government

Federal Parliament - the government that looks after national interests such as immigration, defence and taxes. Everything they can do is listed in Section 51 of the Constitution.

State Government - Looks after the issues that affect people living in the state or territory, such as the police, public transport, hospitals and schools.

Local councils - Looks after the community such as parks, pools, rubbish collection.

### What Happens if...

If a state government makes a [[Law]] and the federal government decides to create a law that is different, then the federal law will be in place. The bigger level of government overrules the rest.

For example, if a council tries to remove bicycle lanes from their own road when the state government passed a bill to build it, the state government can legally stop them.

### Why do we have 3 levels?

Before 1901, each colony was treated as another British territory and allowed to self-govern before 1860 (WA in 1890). The people in each state felt like we needed to all join and create a single country to protect ourselves from war and immigration. 

When Australia was federated as its own country in 1901, the constitution set out 39 different things the federal government can create legislation for.

### What can the Federal Government Do?

They can create laws on many things.

Such as:
- Defence (army, navy, air force)
- Medicare + Centrelink
- Currency (what it’s called and looks like)
- Who can be citizens
- Where the capital is
- Treaties with other countries
- Who pays taxes and how much


### What can the State Government do?

They can create laws on the following:
- Schools (where they are built, what you learn)
- Hospitals and health services
- Roads and public transport
- Utilities such as water and electricity
- Police and many of the laws they enforce
- Forests and state parks

### Who does what?

Hospitals and where they are and what they do - State
Trains and Buses - State
Picking up your rubbish at your local park - Council
How much you pay in taxes - Federal
Protect our country from invaders - Federal
The traffic lights on a road - State
Quakers Hill High School - State

### Tasmanian Dam Case 1983


In 1978 the state-owned Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission announced plans to dam the Franklin River and flood a large wilderness area in south-west Tasmania. Four years later the area was declared a World Heritage site under the World Heritage Convention, to which the federal government is a signatory—Australia has agreed to the convention.

The federal Parliament then passed laws to stop clearing and excavation within the newly listed Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area. The Tasmanian government challenged the laws in the High Court of Australia, arguing the federal Parliament did not have the power to stop the construction of the dam.

### What was done here?

In 1983 the High Court ruled that, under its external affairs power, the federal Parliament could make laws relating to international treaties which Australia had signed. The external affairs power, listed in section 51(xxix) of the Constitution, allows the federal Parliament to enter into international treaties and agreements on behalf of Australia.

Although the federal Parliament has no law-making powers over Tasmania's rivers, dams or environment, the court decided the federal legislation was valid because it allowed the government to meet its commitments under an international treaty—the World Heritage Convention.

### Radio License Case 1935

Until 1974 the federal government charged households a fee or listener's licence for each radio set they owned. The fees were used to pay for radio stations. In 1934 Dulcie Williams from Surry Hills in Sydney refused to pay the listener's licence on the grounds wireless radio is not mentioned in the Constitution. In doing so she challenged the federal Parliament's right to make laws about broadcasting.

### What was done?

The case went to the High Court, who found in favour
of the government based on section 51(v) of the Constitution. This section gives federal Parliament responsibility for 'postal, telegraphic, telephonic and other like services'. The Court decided wireless radio could be defined as being like a telegraphic or telephonic service because it involved sending communications.

  

The High Court's interpretation of section 51(v) means that today the federal Parliament can make laws about all forms of communication, including television and the internet. For example, it has passed laws to regulate the use of the internet, tackle cyber crime and invest in infrastructure such as the National Broadband Network.
